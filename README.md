# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a study for an investment bank that is considering launching a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The study details include what cryptocurrencies are available for purchase and how they can be classified for this new line of investiment. For this project, I have applied unsupervised machine learning functions in order to group the cryptocurrencie on a clustering algorithm. 

## Resources
- Data Source: [Crypto_data.csv](https://github.com/Marietas/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/Resources/crypto_data.csv)
- System: Python 3.7.1


## Results

After preprocessing and cleaning the data the total of 532 different cryptocurrencies were available. From that, the following data could be obtained:

### Elbow Curve

Based on the data the Clustering Cryptocurrencies were obtained running the K-Means being K=4. This value represents the best value to running the unsupervised machine learning and identify the clusters of the cryptocurrencies. The following graph represent the output of this analysis.
