# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a study for an investment bank that is considering launching a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The study details include what cryptocurrencies are available for purchase and how they can be classified for this new line of investiment. For this project, I have applied unsupervised machine learning functions in order to group the cryptocurrencie on a clustering algorithm. 

## Resources
- Data Source: [Crypto_data.csv](https://github.com/Marietas/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/Resources/crypto_data.csv)
- System: Python 3.7.1


## Results

After preprocessing and cleaning the data the total of 532 different cryptocurrencies were available. From that, the following data could be obtained:

### Elbow Curve

We don't know what would be the output of the analysis so we are using unsupervised machine learning to identify clusters of the cryptocurrencies.
We produced the elbow curve below using the K-Means method iterating on k values from 1 to 10.
